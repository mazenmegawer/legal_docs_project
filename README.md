## legal_docs_project

Structured extraction and storage of Arabic legal documents (Fatwas, Judgments, Legislations), Everything runs through Docker Compose, which starts the database and the app that first parses the sample fatwas, then starts the API automatically.

## Overview

  - The database schema is created automatically from SQL during the containerâ€™s first startup.
  - parser reads .docx files, extracts structured fields, and inserts them into Postgres.
  - API provides a simple health check and a /fatwas endpoint to list stored fatwas.

Environment variables are read from .env when running locally and are passed in automatically through Compose.
